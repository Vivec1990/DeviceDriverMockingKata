# Device Driver Mocking Kata

This kata is an implementation of the [Device Driver Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Device-Driver-Kata) by [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache). In difference to Emily's kata this kata already contains the production code and focuses solely on getting the existing code under test using [test doubles](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html) usually called "mocks".

The Java production code is based on [HÃ©ctor Hugo Barriuso Matas](https://github.com/hbarriuso) [solution](https://github.com/hbarriuso/Device-Driver-Kata).
